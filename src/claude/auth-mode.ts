/**
 * Claude auth-mode resolution.
 *
 * The resolver answers exactly ONE question: does the CodexCommander-owned dummy token
 * (`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=codexcommander-proxy`) get injected? That is narrower than "how
 * will Claude authenticate" — native passthrough additionally needs an `sk-ant-`
 * credential on the incoming request — so the field is `markerMode`, not
 * `effectiveAuthMode` (implementation contract R2-1).
 *
 * The admission-key axis is separate and untouched: when the proxy requires an
 * admission key, `buildClaudeEnv` injects it regardless of mode.
