/**
 * The service-home preflight for native-client teardown (WP2, audit r1 #5;
 * implementation contract).
 *
 * `ccx stop` has honored `ServiceOwnershipError` since it started catching it
 * (src/cli/index.ts:464); nothing on the HTTP side ever did. A route that calls
 * `stripGrokConfig` directly would otherwise pull the fence out from under a
 * service running from another CODEX_HOME/CODEXCOMMANDER_HOME — the installed
 * service is still live and the shared state belongs to it.
 *
 * ENABLE is not gated by this: writing our own fence is not a shared teardown,
 * and `injectGrokConfig` already runs unguarded from `ccx start`/`ensure`.
