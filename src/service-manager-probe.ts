/**
 * What the service manager says about this machine, read-only and fail-closed.
 *
 * The question this answers is NOT "is a job loaded". Installation writes the
 * definition BEFORE the state file (`service.ts` install paths) and embeds
 * `CODEX_HOME`/`CODEXCOMMANDER_HOME` inside it, so an interrupted reinstall leaves a
 * valid state file for one home beside an installed definition for another. A
 * probe that only asked about registration would call that owned. On macOS it is
 * worse: a logged-out user has the plist on disk with no GUI domain at all, so
 * registration reports nothing while a foreign definition sits right there.
 *
 * So the probe reads the DEFINITION, parses the homes out of it, and reports
 * what it saw. Comparing those homes is the caller's job — a probe that returned
 * a verdict would be deciding ownership from half the evidence.
 *
 * Every command here is read-only and bounded. The user's proxy runs under a
 * service manager while this executes; a probe that could start, stop or reload
 * anything is not a probe. An unbounded one is not much better, since a wedged
 * manager would hold the event loop.
