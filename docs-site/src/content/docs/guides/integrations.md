title: Client Apps
description: Connect OpenCodex to Codex, Claude Code, Grok Build, OpenCode, Pi, Hermes, OpenClaw, Kimi Code and Gajae Code without mixing client setup with provider credentials.
---

The dashboard calls this area **Client Apps**. It answers “where do I work?” while
**Providers** answers “where does model access come from?” and **API Access** manages
credentials that a client uses to reach the OpenCodex proxy.

| Area | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| **Providers** | Upstream accounts, OAuth logins, API keys, subscription gateways and local model servers |
| **Models** | The enabled/visible catalog exported through the proxy |
| **Routing** | How a request is resolved after it reaches OpenCodex |
| **Client Apps** | Codex App/CLI/SDK, Claude Code/Desktop, Grok Build, OpenCode and other local clients |
| **API Access** | Proxy access keys for clients; never upstream provider credentials |

The old `#integrations/*` hashes remain valid so bookmarks still reach every client
detail surface. Client Apps replaces the eleven-tab strip with one configured/available
catalog and a selected-client detail pane.

:::note[OpenCode is not OpenCode Go]
**OpenCode** is a client app. **OpenCode Go** is a paid model provider and is added under
Providers. OpenCode Go currently uses the API key issued by the OpenCode console; the
OpenCodex registry does not expose an OpenCode Go OAuth login. **OpenCode Free** is a
separate keyless provider preset.
:::

For the five shared file-managed clients, Client Apps writes OpenCodex's provider block
into the client's own config file and removes it again through the same reversible
writer. Each has a switch:

| Client | Config file | Format | When the change takes effect | Credential |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pi | `~/.pi/agent/models.json` | JSON | new sessions | `OPENCODEX_API_KEY` |
| Hermes | `~/.hermes/config.yaml` | YAML | new sessions | `OPENCODEX_HERMES_API_KEY` |
| OpenClaw | `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` | JSON5 | immediately, on a running gateway | `OPENCODEX_OPENCLAW_API_KEY` |
| Kimi Code | `~/.kimi-code/config.toml` | TOML | on restart, or `/reload` | loopback placeholder |
| Gajae Code | `~/.gjc/agent/models.yml` | YAML | new sessions, or when you open `/model` |`OPENCODEX_GAJAE_API_KEY` |

OpenCode has its own detail flow because it needs stronger persistence semantics than
the shared switch. It resolves the active global `opencode.jsonc` or `opencode.json`,
owns only `provider.opencodex`, stores the proxy admission token in protected OpenCodex
state, and writes a `{file:…}` reference instead of embedding the token. The page also
offers auto-connect, one-click Desktop launch, safe refresh, and restore. Restore is
byte-exact while the file is untouched and becomes provider-only after unrelated user
edits, so OpenCode and the shared writer never compete for the same config block.

Paths honor each client's own environment override where it has one, so a relocated
`HERMES_HOME`, `KIMI_CODE_HOME` or `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is followed rather than guessed
at. The table lists each client's default; an override always wins.

OpenClaw has several, and they do different jobs. `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` selects the
file; `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR`, `OPENCLAW_PROFILE` and `OPENCLAW_HOME` select the state
directory, which is also what detection looks at — so a profile or relocated home
still reads as installed, while a config-path override moves only the file. If you
are still on the older `.clawdbot` layout, that is found too: the modern directory
wins when it exists, and the legacy one is used when it is the only one there.

These must be **absolute paths** or start with `~`. A relative one is refused rather
than resolved, because it would mean whatever directory each process happened to
start in — and that path is stored with the backup, so it has to name the same file
tomorrow as it did today.

opencodex reads these from its own environment. If your gateway runs with a profile
or a relocated home, start opencodex with the same variables set, or it will
correctly follow a different installation.

## The other four surfaces use different controls

**API Access** manages opencodex's own client-facing credentials and is not a client at
all. **Codex CLI** is wired by the proxy service itself — starting opencodex applies it,
stopping it restores native routing — so there is no per-file switch. **Claude** keeps
its own enable flag and Desktop's Save/Apply flow, and **Grok Build** keeps its
select-then-apply model fence. Those semantics predate this catalog and are unchanged.

## Which models each client receives

Client Apps does not create a second model catalog. Each integration consumes the
enabled, visible OpenCodex catalog, with the client-specific encoding it requires:

- Codex App, CLI and SDK read the shared Codex catalog.
- Claude Code 2.1.129+ discovers the gateway catalog through `/v1/models`; older builds
  can still use routed ids through `/model` or environment overrides.
- Grok Build's managed fence is regenerated from the visible catalog when OpenCodex
  starts/ensures, and can be refreshed after catalog changes.
- `ocx opencode` generates OpenCode's runtime provider block from the visible catalog on
  every launch. A block applied to disk is a snapshot and must be refreshed after model
  visibility changes.

“Visible” is deliberate: disabled providers, provider allowlists and disabled models can
all narrow what a client sees. A catalog row also proves discoverability, not that an
upstream account currently has quota or that the client has sent a successful request.

## Rollback

Every successful write takes a snapshot of your file *first*, so the state you had is
always recoverable:

- **Undo** appears on the newest operation when your file still matches what we wrote.
- **Restore this point…** appears on older operations, or when the file changed after
  that operation. Restoring across such a change asks a second time before replacing
  your newer edits — and backs them up too, so that restore is itself undoable.
- Ten backups are kept per client. Beyond that, the oldest snapshot files are removed
  and their history rows read **Backup expired**.

Disable removes only the entries opencodex recorded as its own. If your file changed
after we wrote it, the switch locks and disable refuses rather than guessing which
edits were yours.

## What to expect, honestly

**Formatting is not preserved.** Applying parses your config and writes it back out, so
every format may be reformatted, and YAML, JSON5 and TOML additionally lose their
comments. Your settings survive the round trip and the bytes change. If you need the
file exactly as it was, use Restore rather than Disable: the snapshot is a verbatim
copy.

**If a value cannot be rewritten faithfully, the switch refuses instead.** The round
trip covers the value kinds these formats use in practice, and where it does not —
a TOML file using `inf` or `nan`, for instance, which the parser available to us
cannot read back accurately — applying stops and says so rather than writing a
changed value and calling it success. You will see the file named and nothing on
disk will have moved. Editing that file by hand still works; it is only our
automatic rewrite that declines.

**Pi, Kimi Code and Gajae Code only work against a loopback bind.** None of their config
schemas has a place for the `x-opencodex-api-key` header that a non-loopback bind
requires, so a generated config would simply be rejected — and writing one by hand does
not help, because there is nowhere in the file to put the header either. Reaching a
remote opencodex from these clients is not supported directly; give them loopback access
instead, through an SSH tunnel or a local forwarder that adds the header.

**Kimi Code cannot hold an environment reference,** so its config carries an
`opencodex-loopback` placeholder rather than a key. No real credential is ever written
into any client config.

**For `ocx opencode`, the launcher's provider block wins.** That launcher injects
`provider.opencodex` through `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`, which outranks the same entry on
disk — the rest of your opencode config still applies as usual. The switch here is what
matters when you launch `opencode` directly.

## From the terminal

The same operations are available headlessly:

```bash
ocx integration client status
ocx integration client enable --client hermes
ocx integration client disable --client hermes
ocx integration client history --client hermes
ocx integration client restore --op <opId> [--confirm-drift]
```

`--confirm-drift` is never assumed. If the file changed after the operation you are
restoring, the command refuses and tells you, because replacing your newer edits is your
decision to make.

Client details were verified against each project's own configuration format; see the
research notes in `devlog/_fin/260802_client_toggle_api/002_client_toggle_matrix.md`
for what was checked and when.
