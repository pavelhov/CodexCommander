Server settings control how the local proxy listens, protects remote traffic, manages resources, and
runs helper features around provider requests.

## Server fields

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `port` | `number` | `10100` | Proxy listen port. |
| `hostname?` | `string` | `"127.0.0.1"` | Bind address. Non-loopback binds require `CODEXCOMMANDER_API_AUTH_TOKEN`. |
| `proxy?` | `string` | — | Outbound HTTP(S) proxy URL or `${ENV_VAR}`. Applied to `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` only when those variables are unset; loopback remains in `NO_PROXY`. |
| `stallTimeoutSec?` | `number` | `300` | Seconds without upstream data before `response.incomplete`. Minimum 1. |
| `connectTimeoutMs?` | `number` | `200000` | Per-attempt DNS/TCP/TLS/final-header deadline; it ends before body generation. |
| `shutdownTimeoutMs?` | `number` | `5000` | Graceful drain deadline before active turns are aborted. |
| `websockets?` | `boolean` | `false` | Advertise `supports_websockets` for the Responses WebSocket path. False keeps HTTP/SSE. |
| `corsAllowOrigins?` | `string[]` | `[]` | Additional exact origins allowed by CORS. Loopback origins are always allowed. Authority-based browser extension origins such as `chrome-extension://<extension-id>` are supported; `*` is not a wildcard. Firefox and Safari regenerate the extension UUID (per install / per browser launch), so update the entry when the origin changes. |
| `apiKeys?` | `CodexCommanderApiKey[]` | `[]` | Generated `ccx_data_…` credentials accepted by data-plane auth on non-loopback binds. Dashboard-managed; these keys never authenticate `/api/*`. |
| `storageCleanupPolicy?` | `StorageCleanupPolicy` | disabled | Opt-in archived-session cleanup policy. Never enabled implicitly. |
| `appOwnedMemoryBudgetMb?` | `number` | `256` | Cap in MiB for evictable app-owned logs, caches, blobs, and continuation payloads. Range 64–4096; not an RSS cap. |
| `codexAutoStart?` | `boolean` | `true` | Let the Codex shim run `ccx ensure` before launching Codex. False makes ensure a no-op. |
| `codexShimAutoRestore?` | `boolean` | `true` | Restore an installed shim after a completed external Codex update replaces it. Environment opt-out: `CODEXCOMMANDER_CODEX_SHIM_AUTO_RESTORE=0`. |
| `shadowCallIntercept?` | `{ enabled?: boolean; model?: string; sourceModels?: string[] }` | off | Redirect recognized Codex helper/shadow calls to a chosen model at low effort. The default source prefix is `gpt-5.6-luna`; `sourceModels` is an explicit current custom-source override. |
| `webSearchSidecar?` | `CodexCommanderWebSearchSidecarConfig` | on when usable | Web-search sidecar options. |
| `visionSidecar?` | `CodexCommanderVisionSidecarConfig` | on when usable | Image-description sidecar options. |
| `images?` | `CodexCommanderImagesConfig` | automatic OpenAI selection | Standalone Images relay options for Codex `image_gen`. |

## Remote access

The default `127.0.0.1` bind is loopback-only. A non-loopback address such as `0.0.0.0` requires
token authentication on both `/api/*` and the data plane. Export the token before starting:

```bash
export CODEXCOMMANDER_API_AUTH_TOKEN="your-secret-token"
ccx start
```

The proxy refuses a remote bind without this variable. For a background service, export it before
`ccx service install` so launchd, systemd, or Task Scheduler receives it. Clients should send:

```text
x-codexcommander-api-key: your-secret-token
```

| Endpoint | `Authorization: Bearer` | `x-codexcommander-api-key` | `x-api-key` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/v1/responses` | not accepted | **required** | not accepted |
| `/v1/chat/completions` | not accepted | **required** | not accepted |
| `/v1/messages` | accepted | accepted | accepted |
| `/v1/models` | accepted | accepted | accepted |

Responses and Chat Completions reserve `Authorization` for possible Codex Direct passthrough, so only
the dedicated admission header is accepted there. Dashboard-generated `apiKeys` may replace the
environment token after startup; candidates are compared in constant time.

:::caution[LAN exposure]
A `0.0.0.0` bind exposes the proxy and configured provider access to the LAN. Use it only on trusted
networks with a strong token.
:::

### SSH port forwarding

Remote use does not require a remote bind. Keep loopback and forward it:

```bash
ssh -L 20100:localhost:10100 you@remote
```

Any local port works. Requests whose Host resolves to `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `::1` remain
loopback regardless of port, so `http://localhost:20100/v1` works. Set that base URL in the client;
`ccx` writes only the default local `127.0.0.1` address into managed client config.

Provider OAuth callbacks listen on a fixed remote port. Log in on the remote machine or forward that
port too:

```bash
ssh -L 20100:localhost:10100 -L 1455:localhost:1455 you@remote
```

:::caution[Forwarded loopback is unauthenticated]
Plain `ssh -L` listens on your local loopback and is safe for the default unauthenticated bind. Do not
use `ssh -g -L`, broad container publishing, or forwarding modes that expose the client side on
`0.0.0.0`. Bind explicitly with `ssh -L 127.0.0.1:20100:localhost:10100` when unsure.
:::

## Storage cleanup

`storageCleanupPolicy` is disabled by default. When enabled, it runs on `startup`, `daily`, `weekly`,
or `manual` after archived bytes exceed `trigger.archivedBytesOver`. It selects oldest archives toward
either `target.reduceToBytes` or `target.removeOldestPercent`. `mode` defaults to `quarantine`; use
`permanent` only as an explicit destructive choice. The policy persists `lastRun` and `nextRun`.
Configure it on the Storage page or with `GET`/`PUT /api/storage/cleanup-policy`; trigger a manual run
with `POST /api/storage/cleanup-policy/run`.

## Claude Code (`claudeCode`)

These settings govern `/v1/messages`, the `ccx claude` launcher, and the Claude dashboard page.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `claudeCode.bodyStallSec?` | `number` | `90` | Native-passthrough body inactivity budget in seconds while a read is pending, not total duration. Minimum 1; exactly `0` disables. |
| `claudeCode.bodyMaxBytes?` | `number` | `67108864` | Cumulative native-passthrough body cap for streamed and buffered responses. Exactly `0` disables. |
| `claudeCode.authMode?` | `"proxy" \| "subscription"` | auto | How launch handles `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`. Auto detects auth each launch; an explicit value is never overridden. |
| `claudeCode.subagentEffort?` | `"low" \| "medium" \| "high" \| "xhigh" \| "max"` | inherit | Effort written to generated `~/.claude/agents/ccx-*.md`; separate from Codex guidance and proxy caps. Restart through `ccx claude` to regenerate. |

Auto auth selects subscription when stored Claude auth is found, proxy when none is found, and
subscription with a warning when detection is inconclusive. See
[Claude Code auth mode](/guides/claude-code/#auth-mode).

## Shadow calls

Codex uses small helper models for tasks such as titles and commit messages. Enable
`shadowCallIntercept` to redirect recognized source-model prefixes to another configured model. The
replacement runs at low effort. Set `sourceModels` only as an explicit current custom-source
override. Only recognized maintenance request kinds in `x-codex-turn-metadata` are eligible;
normal turns and requests with missing, malformed, or unrecognized metadata are never intercepted.

```json
{
  "shadowCallIntercept": {
    "enabled": true,
    "model": "gpt-5.5",
    "sourceModels": ["gpt-5.6-luna"]
  }
}
```

## Sidecars

### `images` (`CodexCommanderImagesConfig`)

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `provider?` | `string` | automatic OpenAI selection | Explicit custom API-key `openai-responses` provider for the standalone Images relay. |
| `timeoutMs?` | `number` | `300000` | Whole-request timeout for one standalone Images request. |

The `/v1/images/generations` and `/v1/images/edits` relay serves Codex built-in image generation.
See [Codex Integration](/guides/codex-integration/#built-in-image-generation-image_gen) for routing and
provider-selection behavior.

### `webSearchSidecar` (`CodexCommanderWebSearchSidecarConfig`)

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled?` | `boolean` | on when usable | Master switch. |
| `backend?` | `"openai" \| "anthropic"` | auto | Explicit wins; otherwise usable stored Anthropic OAuth selects `anthropic`, then `openai`. |
| `model?` | `string` | backend-dependent | `gpt-5.6-luna` for OpenAI or `claude-sonnet-5` for Anthropic. |
| `reasoning?` | `string` | `low` | Sidecar effort. `minimal` is rejected with web search. |
| `maxSearchesPerTurn?` | `number` | `3` | Real searches allowed per main-model turn. |
| `routedModelStallTimeoutMs?` | `number` | `200000` | Config-file-only routed-model raw-body inactivity deadline. Integer 1–2147483647; every non-empty chunk resets it. |
| `timeoutMs?` | `number` | `60000` | Deadline for one hosted search. |

The OpenAI backend requires a ChatGPT login and enabled ChatGPT `forward` provider. Claude-inbound
routed replays inject main ChatGPT auth into the internal request. The Anthropic backend uses the
active stored credential from an enabled Anthropic OAuth provider. An explicitly selected Anthropic
backend with no usable account fails closed instead of falling back. The Anthropic executor uses its
native `web_search_20250305` tool.

Four clocks govern search: base `stallTimeoutSec`, `connectTimeoutMs`, routed-model inactivity, and
hosted-search timeout. The effective bridge watchdog is the maximum plus 30 seconds. Routed stall is
an inactivity guard, not a total generation deadline.

### `visionSidecar` (`CodexCommanderVisionSidecarConfig`)

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled?` | `boolean` | on when usable | Master image-description switch. |
| `backend?` | `"openai" \| "anthropic"` | auto | Same explicit-first, Anthropic-credential-aware selection as web search. |
| `model?` | `string` | backend-dependent | `gpt-5.4-mini` for OpenAI or `claude-sonnet-5` for Anthropic. |
| `maxDescriptionsPerTurn?` | `number` | `8` | New description cache misses admitted per main turn. `0` disables calls; invalid values use default. |
| `timeoutMs?` | `number` | `45000` | Sidecar fetch timeout. |

Vision activates only for images sent to a model in its provider's `noVisionModels`. OpenAI has the
same login/forward requirements as search; explicitly selected Anthropic fails closed without a usable
credential. Successful `data:` descriptions use a bounded cache keyed by backend, model, detail,
image bytes, and normalized message context. Hits and same-turn duplicates do not consume the limit.
Remote `https:` images and failed or empty descriptions are not cached.

Anthropic OAuth sidecars reuse CodexCommander's existing Claude Code OAuth fingerprint. Soak-test the
intended account and workload.
