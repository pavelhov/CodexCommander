/**
 * Bun test preload — the FIRST line of defense for the developer's real CodexCommander home.
 *
 * `bun run test` already sandboxes HOME/CODEXCOMMANDER_HOME/CODEX_HOME through
 * `scripts/test.ts`. The incident this file prevents happened under a bare
 * `bun test <file>` — the command anyone reaches for while iterating on one test —
 * which gets no wrapper and therefore had no isolation at all. A preload runs for
 * EVERY invocation, so the protection no longer depends on remembering the wrapper.
 * The test process therefore creates its isolation boundary before loading
 * any code that can write state.
 *
 * Import order below is load-bearing: importing the guard captures the real home at
 * module load, and that must happen BEFORE this file replaces HOME.
